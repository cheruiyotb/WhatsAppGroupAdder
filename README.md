# WhatsAppGroupAdderThis Python code is an implementation of a class called WhatsAppGroupAdder, which uses the Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of adding a new member to a WhatsApp group. The class takes the name of the group as input when it is initialized, and then provides a method called add_number to add a new member to the group. The close method is used to close the browser after all the members have been added.

The __init__ method initializes the WebDriver by creating a new instance of the Chrome driver and opening the WhatsApp Web page. Then, it waits for the user to scan the QR code to log in to the WhatsApp Web.

The add_number method first clicks on the "Add Participants" button on the group page, waits for the dialog to appear, enters the phone number of the new member in the input box, and clicks on the "Add" button to add the member to the group.

The close method simply closes the WebDriver instance.

To use this code, create an instance of the WhatsAppGroupAdder class by passing the name of the group you want to add members to. Then, call the add_number method with the phone number of the new member you want to add. Finally, call the close method to close the browser.
